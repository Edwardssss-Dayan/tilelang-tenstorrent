# TTL source code generation

The optional compiler ABI is pinned to TT-Lang commit
`e49ce12c2bcd2350565632d9b51239e9eafb2546`. `load_bindings()` checks the
compiler's `build_info()["ttlang"]`; source/simulator-only installs and unknown
revisions are not sufficient. Importing TileLang does not import TT-Lang.

The public `build_ttl_without_compile` entry accepts only
`tt.ir_stage="device"` current Device IR. It first runs the Device verifier and
the TT-Lang-independent `preflight_ttl_mapping`; diagnostic table expansions,
legacy `tt.device_ir_version` modules, missing resource mappings and unsupported
body operations fail before optional compiler import. Current shared-grid Device
IR does not yet pass this preflight, so the public path does not currently return
a TTL source module.

After the current emitter migration is complete, the entry will construct typed
MLIR operations, verify the module, parse/verify its serialized form and return a
TVM source module (`inspect_source()`, format `ttl`). It will not construct TTNN
objects or launch kernels. The upstream `ttl` package initializer may
import TTNN transitively; a compiler-only installation must provide the
upstream compiler import environment. The only textual type construction is the fixed
`!ttl.transfer_handle<read/write>` token, whose pinned binding has no constructor.

The retained legacy emitter implementation supports single-Core, straight-line
rank-2 DRAM interleaved
elementwise/copy/fill/typecast (v1/v2), clear BF16 GEMM (v2), and BF16 accumulator
GEMM with one complete K update (v5/v7). Device v7 compute values map immutable
value IDs to TTL SSA. Shared/fragment expressions use the same typed arithmetic,
unary, scalar-fill, explicit-cast, and padded zero-axis broadcast builders.
DFB and fragment access maps are resolved separately, including intra-tile
broadcast when the source and destination have identical block shapes.
Compute materialization uses `ttl.store`; fragments never create CB bindings
or transfer handles. A passthrough fragment retains its acquired DFB SSA value.
Device lifetime covers its transitive consumers; Device release ends the
emitter's direct DFB reference, while TT-Lang's acquire/release analysis emits
the physical pop after the last transitive SSA use.
BF16 GEMM sets the compute function's `fp32_dest_acc_en=false`.
At the pinned revision, `ComputeKernelConfigAnalysis.cpp`'s
`resolveKernelConfig` removes all Bits32 candidates for that explicit constraint;
the default `matmul-full-fp32` preference cannot override it. FP32 requirements
and multiple fragment updates are rejected until a persistent-DST schedule can
be verified. This code is not a compatibility path for current Device IR and is
unreachable from the stage-only public entry. Pipeline/multicore Device Lower
remains available. Its typed DFB-to-storage-group resolver is implemented, but
the current TTL operation/control-flow/transport emitter is not.

The pinned finalizer can recolor many static logical DFB declarations into at
most the target's physical CB-index capacity; therefore logical storage-group
count alone is not a preflight failure. Current Lower keeps compiler-made
compact loops and affine Core-dependent generation operands. Non-pipeline
generations share a logical group only when the formation transaction DAG proves
reserve/publication/wait/release FIFO order and remains acyclic after adding each
release-before-reserve reuse edge. Loop-carried transactions that are not
expanded for proof remain independent; pipelined families retain the planner's
explicit pool relation. The pure resolver binds the finite groups required by
each kernel slot from typed producer/consumer ownership without expanding the
body or materializing concrete descriptor tables.

TT-Lang's current DFB identity analysis only traces a CB operand directly to
`ttl.bind_cb` through unrealized casts. The current emitter must therefore add a
narrow family-row resource-selection lowering (or the equivalent TT-Lang op and
analysis support) whose leaves are static `ttl.bind_cb` values. It must not
expand Device loops, enumerate the launch grid, or clone the three Device
functions. This selector and the current operation/control-flow emitter remain
unimplemented.

Device `TensorBacking` describes the tensor origin of a copied DFB. It is not
mapped to TTL `tensor_backing`, which asserts an actual zero-copy L1 storage
alias. DFB IDs are seeded exactly as in the production TT-Lang frontend;
TT-Lang's DFB finalizer owns physical slot allocation. Acquire/release analysis
owns automatic DFB pops; explicit reserves/waits/publication preserve Lower's
operation order.

The legacy integration tests in
`testing/python/target/test_tilelang_tenstorrent_ttl_codegen.py` remain skipped
until they are migrated to the current typed-family contract. Active tests cover
the pure preflight boundary without TT-Lang. Current Device TIRX export has
parser/verifier round-trip coverage, but no current shared-grid TTL parser,
compile-only or hardware validation has yet been performed in this checkout.
`tenstorrent.capabilities.gemm_capability` reports that distinction explicitly;
its dtype legality comes from the native registry.

## Pinned API and lowering audit

The typed builders match the pinned `TTLOps.td` definitions and production
`python/ttl/operators.py` calls. The generated `_ttl_ops_gen.py` is a build
artifact and is absent from the source-only checkout.

| Expression | Builder contract | Lowering evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add/Sub/Mul/Div/Min/Max | Two operands; result inferred by `SameOperandsAndResultType` | `TTLElementwiseOps.def` maps every operation through compute to TTKernel |
| Unary operations | One operand; same result type | `TTLElementwiseOps.def`; Exp carries ODS default flags |
| Log2 | `ttl.log` followed by `ttl.mul_unary_const(input, F32Attr)` | No pinned Log2 operation; both emitted operations have compute/tile lowering |
| Fill/scalar | `ttl.fill(result_type, F32Attr)` | Production `operators.py` fill implementation; `LowerFillToCompute` |
| Cast | `ttl.typecast(result_type, input)` | `LowerTypecastToCompute`; tile lowering derives input/output dtype explicitly |
| Broadcast | `ttl.block_broadcast(result_type, input, DenseI64ArrayAttr, DenseI64ArrayAttr)` | Production broadcast implementation; `LowerBlockBroadcastToCompute` |

Only BF16 and FP32 block expression dtypes are mapped. For both supported
architectures, a BF16 row/column/scalar broadcast conflicts with required
32-bit DST, including a following FP32 cast or FP32 computation in the same
kernel. `check_capability` rejects that combination before optional compiler
import. This restriction is explicit in
`ComputeKernelConfigAnalysis.cpp::supportsDestinationElementWidth` and the
pinned `broadcast_dst_mode_invalid.mlir` tests. FP32 broadcast does not have
that restriction. Ordinary FP32 compute values use the verified kernel
requirement to emit `fp32_dest_acc_en=true`.

Direct tile builders do not remove the multi-update GEMM limitation.
`TileMatmulBlockOp::verify` preserves matmul's dtype constraints, and its
TTKernel lowering reloads an optional accumulator from a DFB. The pinned
`analyzeTensorAccumulationForDst` requires an acquired, same-type contribution
and accepts an additive recurrence without a Matmul in the loop body.
Stateful tensor accumulation scopes explicitly reject required DST lowering.
A persistent GEMM schedule therefore needs further compiler integration and
real compilation evidence; neither a DST attribute nor manually chosen tile
indices establishes the required no-intermediate-BF16-pack guarantee.

This audit establishes API/lowering source correspondence, not a successful
compiler execution. All parser, sync-placement, and full compile-only tests
remain real-compiler tests, never mock-builder tests.
